# Overview
> Python client library for the sports betting API provided by [TheRundown.io](https://therundown.io).

TheRundown Python maps the REST API's endpoints to functions that return nested data objects.

## Features
- Full support for each of the API's endpoints
- Set your preferred timezone and all response data will be converted to that timezone
- Search by sport / league name instead of ID
- Sportsbook lines keyed by sportsbook name instead of ID
- Work with objects instead of raw text
- Response data is validated using [Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/)

You can learn more about the REST API at [RapidAPI.com](https://rapidapi.com/therundown/api/therundown/)

# Installation
